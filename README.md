## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The objective of this project is to build a application that will toggle between an image and its description and allow visitors to like the image with a button. The like button will also increase the count of like for each image. 


I solved this project by setting functions in only files that are closest to where they are needed. All my put and get routers remained on the app where it was needed to communicate with the router. The gallerylist need only to map each item and pass it to the next component. The last component, galleryitem, held most of the function as it needed to do all the work if displaying and counting likes.


From this project, I learned how to properly use props and where to keep states and functions.
